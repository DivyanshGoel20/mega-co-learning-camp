# üéÆ Multiplayer Game Project  

## üìú Overview  
I am building a multiplayer game where users can interact with other players and compete in small mini-games. The goal is to be the last person standing to win. This project is aligned with the "Play" track at the Mega Co-Learning Camp.

## üõ†Ô∏è Problems and Solutions  

### Problem 1: Limited Engagement in Blockchain-Based Games  
Most blockchain-based games lack engaging mechanics and struggle to attract a wider audience.  

**Solution:**  
This game will focus on fun and competitive gameplay while seamlessly integrating blockchain features like rewards, ensuring a balance between tech and entertainment.  

### Problem 2: Accessibility for New Players  
Many Web3 games have steep onboarding requirements, discouraging new users.  

**Solution:**  
The game will have a simple and user-friendly onboarding process, making it easy for anyone to play, even without prior blockchain experience.  

### Problem 3: Lack of Collaborative Development  
Building solo can limit creativity and scope.  

**Solution:**  
The camp provides a collaborative space to brainstorm, refine ideas, and build a polished multiplayer experience.
